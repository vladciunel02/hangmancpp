# Console Hangman

A simple C++ implementation of the classic Hangman game.

## Overview
I created this project to practice C++ fundamentals:
- Arrays and C-strings
- Standard I/O

## Features
- Classic gameplay loop (guess letters, lose lives)
- Input validation (handles case sensitivity)
- Pure console application (no external libraries)

## How to Run

1. Compile:
   g++ hangman.cpp -o hangman

2. Run:
   ./hangman   (on Linux/Mac)
   hangman.exe (on Windows)
